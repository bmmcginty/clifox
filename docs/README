Rough Install Steps
1. Download the self-extracting Firefox from mozilla.org.
wget "ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/latest/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-19.0.2.tar.bz2"
bunzip2 "firefox-*.bz2"
tar -xf "firefox-*.tar"
2. Run xvfb-run "/path/to/firefox"
3. Wait for about ten seconds.
4. Kill the xvfb-run firefox application (ctrl-c).
Note. Symlinks are recommended for the following steps, so that changes to the supported configs are reflected in your Firefox. Please realize that this will open your Firefox version to any vulnerabilities created by the eveloper's configs.
5. link the prefs.js file from the firefox folder in the root of this repo to your newly created profile folder.
e.g. ln -s /home/user/dev/clifox/firefox/prefs.js /home/user/firefox/randomid.default/prefs.js
6. Link the mozrepl folder into your Mozilla extensions folder with the mozilla recommended format. (No, this is not your standard symlink. It is a path written to a textfile.)
e.g. echo "$(pwd)/mozrepl" > /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/randomid.default/extensions/mozrepl\@hyperstruct.net
7. Hope fervently.
8. Run:
xvfb-run /dir/to/firefox/firefox
You should see a message such as:
"I, MOZREPL : Listening : 127.0.0.1:4242"
If not, something is wrong with the link to mozrepl, the prefs.js file, or your version of firefox.
9. Run:
./clifox 'http://www.linux-speakup.org/'
If all goes well, you should be shown the homepage for the linux-speakup project. Errors are placed in ~/.clifox/clifox.log.
Happy browsing.
