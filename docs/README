Rough Install Steps

Note. On debian systems the packages xvfb, libgtk2.0-0 and libatk1.0-0
are necessary in addition to any required python packages.

1. Download the self-extracting Firefox from mozilla.org.
wget "ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/latest/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-19.0.2.tar.bz2" # It's up to 20.0.2.

tar -jxf "firefox-*.tar.bz2"

2. cd into firefox directory and run xvfb-run "/path/to/firefox"

3. Wait for about ten seconds.

4. Kill the xvfb-run firefox application (ctrl-c).

Note. Symlinks are recommended for the following steps, so that
changes to the supported configs are reflected in your Firefox. Please
realize that this will open your Firefox version to any
vulnerabilities created by the developer's configs.

Note. The reference to random.id in the following statements is to
indicate a randomly generated id used in file names and directories.

5. link the prefs.js file from the firefox folder in the root of this
repo to your newly created profile folder.  e.g. ln -sf
~/src/clifox/firefox/prefs.js
~/.mozilla/firefox/randomid.default/prefs.js

6. Link the mozrepl folder into your Mozilla extensions folder with
the mozilla recommended format. (No, this is not your standard
symlink. It is a path written to a textfile.)  e.g. 
echo "$(pwd)/mozrepl" >
~/.mozilla/firefox/randomid.default/extensions/mozrepl\@hyperstruct.net

7. Hope fervently.

8. Run:
xvfb-run /dir/to/firefox/firefox
You should see a message such as:

"I, MOZREPL : Listening : 127.0.0.1:4242"

If not, something is wrong with the link to mozrepl, the prefs.js
file, or your version of firefox.

9. Run:
mkdir ~/.clifox
./clifox 'http://www.linux-speakup.org/'

If all goes well, you should be shown the homepage for the
linux-speakup project. Errors are placed in ~/.clifox/clifox.log.

Happy browsing.
