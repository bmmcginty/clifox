when we do a refresh, grab the old display of all the nodes as a "\n" delimited list of all the lines, and compare the new refresh to that, moving you to the first line where the non-whitespace differs

see if we can get a partially loaded page, e.g.
<script>
var i,t;
i=0;
while(i<100) {
t=document.head.appendChild(document.createElement("script"));
t.type="text/javascript";
t.src="http://apps.bmcginty.us/cgi-bin/sleep.cgi?wait=1000&i="+i.toString();
i+=1;
}
</script>

fix logging config values to be consistent (maybe make debug a value of 99, so when debug is used, it sets logging to 99)

add autoForms mode option so typing edits form field

make prompts just lines on the screen, where statusbar is editted

check to make sure objects won't get confused on the python side, e.g.:
self.page,self.js.clifox.getActiveTab()

unurlencode img.src's

use gbrowser.visibletabs[idx].linkedBrowser.*uri* for loading urls (avoid dead page issues)

add -tab option and -tablist option so you can direct a tab to a webpage without loading the repl.map with objects that will be stale almost at once

fix wrapping (check about:memory for a good example)

truncate images to a reasonable length if they are img.src (maybe limit the .src to the length of the current line, or use link.textContent, or it's length, as the preexisting lengthf or the line

done. prompter overriding example:
https://selenium.googlecode.com/git-history/fe33beb172e65c6b1518223ccddc5494ad0856e4/javascript/firefox-driver/js/promptService.js

done. continuing to run for rest of thread while waiting for user to respond to dialog:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Code_snippets/Threads
var thread = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/thread-manager;1"]
                        .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIThreadManager)
                        .currentThread;
 while (!complete)
   thread.processNextEvent(true);
