Welcome:

This is Clifox, a wrapper around Firefox and it's internals, that allows the browser to be used from the command line.
This application is not feature complete, though browsing most websites is easy enough.

Prerequisits:

python 2.6 or python 2.7
xvfb
python-json

Installation:

Please install your systems version of Mozilla Firefox.
On Debian and Ubuntu, this is known as iceweasel.
Other systems will have their own names for Firefox.
Once this package is installed, please insure that a symlink exists in your path, that points to the new package.
This symlink should be called firefox.
To make sure this symlink exists, run:
which firefox
If you get a path printed from this command, all is well.
If you don't get any output,
please send your linux distribution name and release version to us, as well as the name of the package you installed to fulfill the Firefox role.
(Read the docs/support file for contact information.)
Install the extension wrapper (as we're still trying to get the code together to force clifox to run automatically).
Run:
make dev
Create the ~/.clifox directory.
run:
mkdir ~/.clifox
Copy the sample config:
cp clifox.conf ~/.clifox/
Ignore this line as of now. It will replace the above steps. Run the file ./install.sh in the root directory of this code.

Run:

To run firefox, in this application directory, type:
./run
This will runn Firefox in the background.
The process ID of firefox will be displayed, so that you can later terminate it, if needed.
To access the running firefox instance, run:
./clifox
This connects Clifox to the running instance of Firefox.

Usage:

Key bindings can be found in ~/.clifox/clifox.conf.
Logs are in ~/.clifox/clifox.log.

Happy browsing.
