Welcome:

This is Clifox, a wrapper around Firefox and it's internals, that allows the browser to be used from the command line.
This application is not feature complete, though browsing most websites is easy enough.

Prerequisits:

python 2.6 or python 2.7
xvfb
python-json

Installation:

Please install your systems version of Mozilla Firefox.
On Debian and Ubuntu, this is known as iceweasel.
Other systems will have their own names for Firefox.
Once this package is installed, please insure that a symlink exists in your path, that points to the new package.
This symlink should be called firefox.
To make sure this symlink exists, run:
which firefox
If you get a path printed from this command, all is well.
If you don't get any output,
please send your linux distribution name and release version to us, as well as the name of the package you installed to fulfill the Firefox role.
(Read the docs/support file for contact information.)
Run the file ./install.sh in the root directory of this code.

Run:

To run firefox, in this application directory, type:
./run
This will runn Firefox in the background.
The process ID of firefox will be displayed, so that you can later terminate it, if needed.
To access the running firefox instance, run:
./clifox
This connects Clifox to the running instance of Firefox.

Usage:

Key bindings can be found in ~/.clifox/clifox.conf.
Logs are in ~/.clifox/clifox.log.

Happy browsing.

Custom Notes

The install script  will do the following:
1. Download the self-extracting Firefox from mozilla.org (latest stable version).
example:
wget "ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/latest/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-19.0.2.tar.bz2" # It's up to 20.0.2.
tar -jxf "firefox-*.tar.bz2"

2. cd into firefox directory and run xvfb-run "/path/to/firefox"

3. Run Firefox to initialize the config directorys.

4. Run again to insure initialization.

5. Wait for about ten seconds.

6. Kill the xvfb-run firefox application (ctrl-c).

Note. Symlinks are recommended for the following steps, so that
changes to the supported configs are reflected in your Firefox. Please
realize that this will open your Firefox version to any
vulnerabilities created by the developer's configs.

Note. The reference to random.id in the following statements is to
indicate a randomly generated id used in file names and directories.

7. link the prefs.js file from the firefox folder in the root of this
repo to your newly created profile folder.  e.g. ln -sf
~/src/clifox/firefox/prefs.js
~/.mozilla/firefox/randomid.default/prefs.js

8. Link the mozrepl folder into your Mozilla extensions folder with
the mozilla recommended format. (No, this is not your standard
symlink. It is a path written to a textfile.)  e.g. 
echo "$(pwd)/mozrepl" >
~/.mozilla/firefox/randomid.default/extensions/mozrepl\@hyperstruct.net

9. Hope fervently.

10. Run:
xvfb-run /dir/to/firefox/firefox
You should see a message such as:

"I, MOZREPL : Listening : 127.0.0.1:4242"

If not, something is wrong with the link to mozrepl, the prefs.js
file, or your version of firefox.

11. Run:
mkdir ~/.clifox
./clifox 'http://www.linux-speakup.org/'

If all goes well, you should be shown the homepage for the
linux-speakup project. Errors are placed in ~/.clifox/clifox.log.
